This repository contains my work for the **Winters in Data Science (WiDS) 2025** project at **IIT Bombay**, focused on understanding and building **Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs)** from scratch.

## 📖 About the Project

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in the concepts that power modern reasoning-capable AI systems. The journey progresses from fundamental Machine Learning concepts through Reinforcement Learning algorithms, which form the backbone of techniques like **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** used in training reasoning models.
